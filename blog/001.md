### Some random thoughts

##### Naming stuff
I spend way too much time naming things.  A good name is very useful, I get
stuck trying to come up with esthetically and useful names.  Some of the rules of GO don't help.
Ex:

Start with an interface returning a ID (I won't get into the ID or Id argument),
Then implement it.

```
type Thing interface {
	ID() int
}

type MyThing struct {
	id int
}

func (m *MyThing) ID() int {
	return m.ID
}
```

That works very well.... except if you need to make ID public which is required if you 
want to marshal/unmarshal the value.  So you end up wanting to name it 
```
 type MyThing struct {
 	ID int
 }
 
 func (m *MyThing) ID() int {
 	return m.ID
 }
```
But that does not compile because you have a method and field with the same name.
Could name the field Id - but yuck.
ValueID (IDValue) double yuck
ThingID sorta yuck, is redundant
