# Step Two - Mulligan

With a large pile of sawdust on the floor I'm calling a do-over and
rethinking how I'm configuring an adventure.  Having a generic engine
and a configuration driven object will be too restrictive.  Either the 
engine will have to become more and more complicated to support features 
or some kind of scripting used.  The purpose of this is to write GO code
not lua or some other script and use GO as a wrapper to run scripts.

New design - everything in code, if you want to have a new adventure then you
have to add code to the project.  It will support multiple stories but each will 
be its own package(s).

#### Saving state
Defining boundaries using interfaces is great, but you have to have concrete objects 
to unmarshal.  After some reflection it occurred to me that to restore a particular 
state all you have to do is to start at the beginning and re-apply all the steps that
modified the state.  So we'll save all of the command lines that changed state and when
we want to load a particular state we'll reapply them to the zero state.  It's simple and performance 
won't be too bad I'm thinking.  If it is then we'll readdress it.  It may cause issues for
the future web interface, but once again we'll deal with that when (if) it becomes a problem.
